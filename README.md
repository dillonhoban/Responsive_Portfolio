## Description

I am a student in the UCSD Coding Bootcamp expecting to graduate in March of 2021. This is my first portfolio site! As you can see there are many more elements to add and this will be a work in progress throughout the course. This site was built utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

The site has four pages: 
1. About contains a brief bio and headshot.
2. Portfolio with images and links to some of my finished projects.
3. Contact contains a basic form that will be improved in future updates (see below.)
4. Resume contains a downloadable PDF version of my current resume, as well as links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. 

All pages are styled using the same stylesheet and each have unique Bootstrap elements. 

## Deployment

## Future Updates

<li> revisit the navbar to fix the transparency issue
<li> add functional JS element to the contact page so email forwarding can work
<li> continue updating the responsive Bootstrap elements to improve mobile experience

## Validation 
This siteâ€™s HTML was validated using a third party service found [here.](https://validator.w3.org/)
