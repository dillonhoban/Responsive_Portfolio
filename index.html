              <p>I am a recent theatre graduate from SDSU looking to diversify my skill set with the hopes of transitioning to a more stable career during these unpredictable times.

              I was born and raised in Encinitas, California. 
            
              I enjoy cooking, making cocktails, woodworking, home improvement, creating and discussing theatre and film, and gaming. 
            
              My dream job is to make my living as an actor on the stage and screen, a path I plan to pursue again when the timing is right. I also have goals of owning my own property rental business of houses I have designed and renovated myself.
            
              I am currently renting a studio in Mission Hills. The place is small but comfortable, something I better start getting used to because tiny living and van life are definitely on my horizon. I like the area a lot and because I moved in during quarantine, I am looking forward to trying all the restaurants and bars when they start opening back up.
              </p>

            <div class="col">
              <p>I want to be a web developer because I believe the skills required are incredibly versatile and valuable in almost every area I am interested in. You cannot operate a business in this day and age without a website and I have seen first hand at my current job the havoc a poorly designed website can wreak on the operations of an enterprise. I want to be part of the solution for turning business concepts into a reality.
